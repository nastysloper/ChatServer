This project is borrowed from the computer science 
department at Loyola Marymount:

http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/javanetexamples/

The project is a sequence of increasingly complicated client-
server applications using Java sockets.

### Version 1

Date Server

The first server listens on a port and prints the date
when a client connects. You can connect using the Unix
utility nc (if installed) or using a simple client that connects to the
server and prints the server's response.

$ nc localhost 59090

Check that your server is running using the Unix netstat
utility:

$ netstat -an | grep <port number>
